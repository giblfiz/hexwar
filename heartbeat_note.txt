MODE: FULLY AUTONOMOUS - NEVER BE IDLE! Always progress the pipeline!

TERMINOLOGY REMINDER:
- FITNESS = balance score (1.0 = perfect 50/50, 0.0 = one-sided)
- FITNESS IS NOT WIN RATE - don't confuse them!
- High fitness = even/balanced matchup, which is the GOAL

CURRENTLY RUNNING:
- orc_vs_fey_extended (PID 332728)
- 100 generations at D5, population 20, 12 games/eval
- Started: 01:30 UTC
- Progress at 03:15: Generation ~57 of 100 (57%)
- Best fitness: 0.789 (meaning ~60/40 balance - good!)
- Average fitness: 0.778 (population converging)
- ETA completion: ~05:25 UTC

FITNESS TRAJECTORY:
- Gen 1: 0.231 (very imbalanced)
- Gen 22: 0.579 (getting better)
- Gen 49: 0.789 (breakthrough - reasonably balanced!)
- Current: 0.789 (holding steady)

WHEN EVOLUTION COMPLETES:
1. Check final fitness - target > 0.70 for decent balance
2. Run validation at D6 to confirm
3. If Orc-Fey balanced, check Orc-Necro and Fey-Necro
4. Continue cyclic refinement as needed
5. Push results to display

CRITICAL: Never leave system idle! Always have something running!

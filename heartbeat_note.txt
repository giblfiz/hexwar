Time: 2026-02-01 01:31 UTC

MODE: FULLY AUTONOMOUS - NEVER BE IDLE! Always progress the pipeline!

CURRENTLY RUNNING:
- orc_vs_fey_extended (PID 332728)
- 100 generations at D5, population 20
- Target: Evolve Orcs to beat dominant Fey (87-94% win rate)
- Log: orc_vs_fey_extended.log
- Output: orc_vs_fey_extended_0201_0130/

PROBLEM BEING SOLVED:
- Fey champion is overpowered (wins 87-94% of games)
- Previous Orc evolution only got to 31% win rate
- This extended run should find stronger Orc compositions

WHEN EVOLUTION COMPLETES:
1. Check fitness - target > 0.60 for decent balance
2. Run diagnostic: evolved Orc vs Fey, vs Necro
3. If still imbalanced, consider:
   - Evolving Necro to counter Fey
   - Manual Fey nerf (remove pieces)
   - Another Orc evolution round
4. Push results to display

CRITICAL RULE: Never leave system idle! Always have something running!

Timeline estimate:
- D5 with 100 gens, pop 20, 12 games = several hours
- Check back every heartbeat for progress
